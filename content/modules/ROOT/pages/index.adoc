# Workshop Overview - Introduction

Welcome to the *OpenShift Inner and Outer Loop Development* workshop! We're glad to have you here with us!

## About this lab

This workshop provides you with your own link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[*Red Hat OpenShift*,window='_blank'] cluster, and a series of exercises that teach you how to apply GitOps principles to a sample application. You will learn how to use link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/5ec54a4628834587a6b85ca5[*OpenShift Pipelines*,window='_blank'] to create a CI/CD pipeline, and how to use link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/gitops[*OpenShift GitOps*,window='_blank'] to deploy your application to multiple environments. You will also learn how to use link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*OpenShift Dev Spaces*,window='_blank'] to develop and test your application locally, within the web browser.

// This lab will guide you through the process of inner and outer loop development, using  to code and push changes to a Git repository, as well as start Tekton pipelines. Then, we'll use Argo CD to sync our application in both development and production environments. Through this lab, you'll learn how to set up and manage the entire application lifecycle within a Red Hat OpenShift cluster.

## Introduction

This workshop's demo application is a simple app that allows users to vote for their favorite option, currently a cat or dog, and view the results. In this lab, you will work with two main components: the `vote-api` (Go) and the `vote-ui` (Python).

This lab aims to demonstrate how to create a seamless CI/CD pipeline using OpenShift, Tekton, Argo CD, and OpenShift Dev Spaces. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of GitOps and have learned how to:

- Set up an OpenShift cluster and prepare it for a GitOps workflow.
- Work with Tekton to run multiple Pipelines to manage our image-building process.
- Use webhooks to trigger pipelines automatically with Git.
- Deploy and manage the `vote-api` and `vote-ui` applications using Argo CD.
- Work with OpenShift Dev Spaces for an integrated development experience.
- Implement GitOps principles for managing your application environments.
- Monitor and manage drifts in your applications and environments.

== What is OpenShift

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift,window='_blank'], the industry's leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes, brings together tested and trusted services to reduce the friction of developing, modernizing, deploying, running, and managing applications. OpenShift delivers a consistent experience across public cloud, on-premise, hybrid cloud, or edge architecture.

== What is GitOps

link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops[GitOps,window='_blank'] is a declarative way to implement continuous deployment for cloud-native applications. GitOps handles and automates complex deployments quickly, saving time during deployment and release cycles. You can use GitOps to create repeatable processes for managing OpenShift clusters and applications across multi-cluster Kubernetes environments.

## Next Steps

Ready to get started with the lab? Let's begin, firstly, by learning a bit of theory about the inner vs. outer loop of development.
