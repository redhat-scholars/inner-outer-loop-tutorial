# Wrapping things up

Congratulations on completing the workshop! You have successfully deployed the Vote Application to OpenShift using Developer Hub, Tekton pipelines, and Argo CD. You have also learned how to use OpenShift Dev Spaces to develop cloud-native applications and make changes in real-time.

Thus far, you have:

- Explored the Developer Hub and discovered the catalog and software templates.
- Used Developer Hub to setup a GitOps workflow using OpenShift, Tekton, and Argo CD.
- Deployed the Vote Application using the backend and frontend software templates.
- Manually triggered pipelines to build and deploy the applications, and move from one environment to another.
- Utilized OpenShift Dev Spaces to develop and test the application.
- Learned how Argo CD manages application deployments and synchronization.
- Explored the self-healing capabilities of Argo CD and how it maintains consistency between the desired state and the actual state of the application.
- Scaled the application using the GitOps approach by modifying the configuration in the Git repository.
