# Continuous Deployment with Argo CD

With the Vote Application deployed to both the development and production environments, we can now explore how link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[*Argo CD*,window='_blank'] manages our application deployment and synchronization. Argo CD follows the GitOps pattern of using Git repositories as the source of truth for defining the desired application state. When a Git repository is updated with new changes, Argo CD automatically synchronizes these changes and deploys them to the corresponding Kubernetes cluster. In this section, we will demonstrate how Argo CD maintains consistency between the desired state defined in the Git repository and the actual state of the application running in the cluster.

## Managing the Vote Application in Argo CD

Let's easily view and access Argo CD by navigating to Developer Hub, selecting the `vote-ui-{user}` component, where we can easily view the different Argo CD applications associated with this specific component, as well as their sync status and health. Let's select the `vote-ui-{user}-dev` application to begin with.

image::argocd-overview-rhdh.png[Argo CD in Developer Hub]

From here, we can view details such as the Repo Url, Path, and more, but let's select *Open Argo CD Dashboard* to view the application in the Argo CD dashboard.

image::argocd-dev-hub.png[Argo CD in Developer Hub]

You'll be logging in with the `admin` username, but your same password at the Argo CD login page. As a reminder, here are your credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `{password}`

image::argocd-login.png[Argo CD Login]

In the Argo CD dashboard, you'll automatically be redirected to the `vote-ui-{user}-dev` application. The application details page provides an overview of the application's deployment status, including the sync status, health, and resource status. You can also see the application's deployment history and the associated Git repository.

### Scaling the Application

Let's explore how Argo CD handles manual changes made directly to the application running in the cluster. In this example, we will attempt to scale the application to three replicas using the OpenShift Web Console.

Firstly, navigate to the OpenShift Web Console's *Topology* view and select the`vote-app-dev-{user}` project where the Vote Application is deployed in the development environment.

image::openshift-argocd-topology.png[OpenShift Topology]

Select the `vote-ui` deployment as an example, and on the *Details* page, scale the Pods to 3 replicas.

image::openshift-scale-replicas.png[Scale Replicas]

After you notice the deployment has been scaled up, return to the Argo CD dashboard. You'll see that the application is now marked as _"OutOfSync"_ because the actual state of the application in the cluster differs from the desired state defined in the Git repository.

image::argocd-out-of-sync.png[Argo CD Out of Sync]

### Synchronizing the Application in Development

To bring the application back in sync with the desired state defined in the Git repository, we need to perform a manual synchronization using Argo CD. In the Argo CD dashboard, click on the *SYNC* button for the vote-app application.

image::argocd-sync-button.png[Argo CD Sync Button]

Review the synchronization options, although you don't need to adjust anything, and click on SYNCHRONIZE to initiate the synchronization process.

image::argocd-sync-options.png[Argo CD Sync Options]

Argo CD will now synchronize the application by reverting the manual changes made in the cluster and aligning the application's state with the desired state defined in the Git repository. After the synchronization is complete, the application will be marked as "Synced" and "Healthy" in Argo CD.

image::argocd-synced.png[Argo CD Synced]

TIP: If you happen to view the OpenShift Web Console *Topology*, you'll notice that the application has been scaled back to the desired state of one replica.

### Reviewing Self-Healing Configuration

Argo CD provides a self-healing feature that automatically reverts any manual changes made directly to the application in the cluster. This ensures that the desired state defined in the Git repository is always maintained. To review the self-healing configuration for the Vote Application, navigate to the application details page in Argo CD. Let's click on the *APP DETAILS* tab and scroll down to the Sync Policy section.

image::argocd-sync-policy.png[Argo CD Sync Policy]

Here, you can see that the selfHeal option is disabled for the development environment (`vote-app-dev-{user}`) but after navigating to the Argo CD application `vote-ui-{user}-prod`, it is enabled for the production environment (`vote-app-prod-{user}`).

image::argocd-self-heal-on.png[Argo CD Self-Heal]

The self-healing configuration is defined in the application's GitOps repository, which you can view by navigating to the `vote-ui-gitops` repository in GitLab.

Open the `argocd/vote-ui-user1-argocd-app-prod.yaml` file and locate the `selfHeal` configuration at the bottom.

[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
----

This configuration ensures that any manual changes made to the application in the development environment will be allowed, and manual changes in the production environment will be automatically reverted by Argo CD.

### Viewing Self-Healing in Action

To demonstrate the self-healing feature, let's attempt to scale the `vote-ui` deployment to three replicas again using the OpenShift Web Console *Topology* view, in the `vote-app-prod-{user}` project. Here, try to increase the number of replicas to 3.

image::openshift-scale-replicas-to-3.png[Scale Replicas]

After scaling the deployment, you'll notice that any manual changes are reversed, and new pods are terminated. 

image::argocd-self-heal-terminate.png[Argo CD Self-Heal]

Instantly in the background, Argo CD will automatically detect the manual changes made to the application and initiate a synchronization process to revert the deployment to the desired state defined in the Git repository.

image::argocd-self-heal-sync.png[Argo CD Self-Heal Sync]

## Scaling the Application using GitOps

To scale the application using the GitOps approach, we need to make changes to the application's configuration in the Git repository via the Helm chart. Let's scale the `vote-api` deployment to five replicas by updating the `values.yaml` file in the `vote-app-gitops` repository. From GitLab, *open* the `helm/app/values.yaml` file.

By selecting the *Edit* button, you can modify the spec.replicas field to the desired number of replicas (e.g., 5).

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
replicaCount: 5
----

image::gitlab-edit-values.png[GitLab Edit Values]

As you edit the files and commit the changes, create a new merge request targeting a new branch (e.g., `patch-vote-ui-replicas`), and click *Commit changes* when ready.

image::gitlab-merge-request.png[GitLab Merge Request]

Now, create and review the merge request (as this is an informative workshop, no need to fill out the details of this merge request). Hit *Create merge request*.

image::gitlab-create-merge-request.png[GitLab Create Merge Request]

Reviewing this merge request, you can see the *Changes* section to view the edit made to the `values.yaml` file. Click on *Merge* to adopt the changes into the target branch.

image::gitlab-merge-changes.png[GitLab Merge Changes]

Once the merge request is merged, Argo CD will automatically detect the changes in the Git repository and trigger a synchronization process. Navigate to the Argo CD dashboard and feel free to observe the synchronization process. Argo CD will update the application's deployment to match the desired state defined in the Git repository. After the synchronization is complete, the application will be scaled to the specified number of replicas (e.g., 5).

image::argocd-scaled.png[Argo CD Scaled]

We can also verify the changes by viewing the `vote-api` deployment in the OpenShift Web Console *Topology* view in the `vote-app-prod-{user}` project. The deployment will now be scaled to five replicas, as defined now in the GitOps repository.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully explored the GitOps workflow using Argo CD. You learned how to view the application's state in Argo CD, handle manual changes, synchronize the application, review self-healing configuration, and scale the application using the GitOps approach. By leveraging GitOps principles, you can declaratively manage your application's configuration and enjoy the benefits of automated deployments and easy rollbacks.



















## Creating a new application using Argo CD

Let's use Argo CD to create a new application. While you can access Argo CD from the *Lab Guides* or by using this link:https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Argo CD link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. You can also visit Argo CD from your OpenShift cluster. Within the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the `argocd-%USERID%` project, and visit the *Topology* page.

image::argocd-button.png[Argo CD Button]

Click on the *Argo CD* route to visit the Argo CD dashboard. You'll be prompted to log in to Argo CD, and you can use the *Login with OpenShift* button to do so.

image::argocd-login.png[Argo CD Login]

Within the Argo CD web console, click the *+ New App* button. This will open the *New Application* form, where we can fill in the necessary information to create a new application in our development environment.

image::argocd-new-app.png[Argo CD New App]

Fill in the following information, many of which may auto-fill when selected:

* Application Name: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`
* Project Name: `default`
* Sync Policy: `Automatic`
* Self Heal: `Disabled`
* Auto-Create Namespace: `Enabled`
* Repository URL: 

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
http://gitea.gitea.svc:3000/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops
----

* Revision: `main`
* Path: `environments/dev`
* Cluster URL: `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
* Namespace: `vote-app-dev-%USERID%`


image::argocd-new-app-form.png[Argo CD New App Form]
image::argocd-new-app-form-2.png[Argo CD New App Form Continued]

When finished, click the *CREATE* button in the top left-hand corner. This will create the application in Argo CD and begin the syncing process.

## Viewing the application in Argo CD

Now, let's view the application in the Argo CD dashboard. After creating the application, you should be redirected to the application details page. If not, click on the application's name to view the application details.

image::argocd-app-details.png[Argo CD App Details]

Here, you'll see the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application's health, sync status, and associated resources. Your application may sync very quickly, with a green `Synced` status, however, you may see a yellow `OutOfSync` status.

image::argocd-app-details-2.png[Argo CD App Details Continued]

We can see the associated resources within the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application, including the `vote-ui` deployment, `vote-api` deployment, and `vote-ui` route. We can also see the services associated with each deployment.

## Viewing the application in the OpenShift web console


You might be wondering what creating your Application in Argo CD achieved. From the OpenShift web console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the *Topology* tab. Here, we can view the *vote-app* application group and view the `vote-ui` deployment in our browser by link:https://vote-ui-vote-app-dev-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*clicking the route*,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

image::dev-topology.png[OpenShift Topology]

This will open the application in a new tab, and we can view the deployed application!

image::vote-app-access.png[Voting App Access]

Great! We're able to see the newly deployed Vote App in our browser through this development environment.

## Using the Web Terminal to modify the development project

Now, let's use the OpenShift Web Terminal to modify a deployment and demonstrate that we still need to establish self-healing or high availability. From the OpenShift Web Console in the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, click on the *Terminal* icon from the top right of the page.

image::terminal-icon.png[Web Terminal Icon]

This is the OpenShift Web Terminal, which allows us a terminal in a pod from the OpenShift Web Console and run commands directly within the cluster. Let's run the following command to scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
oc scale deployment vote-ui --replicas=2
----

image::scale-up.png[Scale Up]

This command will scale up the `vote-ui` deployment to 2 replicas. Now, we can return to the Argo CD `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application to see how the application has automatically been determined to be out of sync.

image::argocd-app-details-3.png[Argo CD App Details]

As this is our development project, we specified Argo CD to not manually adjust our application when drift is detected, however, in our production environment, we'll enable this for high availability. For now, click *Sync* and select *Synchronize* to sync the application back to the manifests in the link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops[Vote App GitOps,role='params-link',window='_blank'] repository.

image::argocd-sync.png[Argo CD Sync]

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed the Vote App to the development environment using Argo CD, we can use OpenShift Dev Spaces to develop and test the application locally before moving to the production module and deploying the application in the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` project.
