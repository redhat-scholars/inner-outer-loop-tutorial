# Inner Loop Development - Introduction

In this module, we'll perform several steps during the inner loop development phase of the Vote App deployment using Developer Hub, OpenShift Pipelines, OpenShift GitOps, and OpenShift Dev Spaces.

## Development Module Flow

- We'll start by running two CI/CD pipelines using Tekton provided by OpenShift Pipelines and afterward enable automation using a git webhook for our pipeline. 
- Next, we will pre-deploy the application to our `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` environment using Argo CD through OpenShift GitOps. 
- After, we can make changes to the code and push them to the repository using OpenShift Dev Spaces. We'll see how Tekton automatically detects the changes and triggers a new build. 
- Argo CD will then detect a drift between what is declared in Git and what is available in the cluster, and we'll manually sync the application.
- Finally, we will use the OpenShift Web Terminal to manually scale the deployment, as we still need to implement high-availability in the next module.

- We'll start by exploring the Developer Hub, learning about internal developer platforms, software templates, learning paths, and the tech radar.
- Using software templates, we will create the backend (`vote-api`) and frontend (`vote-ui`) components, along with their respective GitOps repositories.
- We'll review the created repositories and explore the CI/CD pipelines, API definitions, and other plugins in the Developer Hub.
- Next, we will access the user workspace (OpenShift Dev Spaces) to explore and understand the inner loop development workflow.
- Inside the workspace, we will make a change to the frontend (e.g., changing the voting options from cat vs. dog to cat vs. unicorn) and test the changes locally.
- Once satisfied with the changes, we will commit and push them to the GitOps repository, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
- We'll verify the changes in the dev environment deployed by the CI/CD pipeline.

## Next Steps 

In this module, we'll focus on the inner loop development process, which involves making changes to the application code, testing them locally, and pushing the changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline. We'll learn how the Developer Hub, OpenShift Pipelines, and OpenShift Dev Spaces work together to streamline this process. Let's get started!
