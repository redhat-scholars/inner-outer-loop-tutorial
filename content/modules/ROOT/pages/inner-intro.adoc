# Workshop Development - Introduction

In this module, we'll perform a few steps during our development phase of the Vote App deployment.

## Development Module Flow

- We'll start by running two CI/CD pipelines using Tekton provided by OpenShift Pipelines and afterward enable automation using a git webhook for our pipeline. 
- Next, we will pre-deploy the application to our `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` environment using Argo CD through OpenShift GitOps. 
- After, we can make changes to the code and push them to the repository using OpenShift Dev Spaces. We'll see how Tekton automatically detects the changes and triggers a new build. 
- Argo CD will then detect a drift between what is declared in Git and what is available in the cluster, and we'll manually sync the application.
- Finally, we will use the OpenShift Web Terminal to manually scale the deployment, as we still need to implement high-availability in the next module.

## Next Steps 

Great, we'll be learning a lot through this development module! Let's begin.
