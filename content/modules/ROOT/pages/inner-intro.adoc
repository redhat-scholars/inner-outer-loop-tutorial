# An Introduction to the Workshop Today

In this module, we'll perform several steps during the inner loop development phase of the Vote App deployment.

## Module Flow

- We'll start by exploring the Developer Hub, learning about internal developer platforms, software templates, learning paths, and the tech radar.
- Using software templates, we will create the backend (`vote-api`) and frontend (`vote-ui`) components, along with their respective GitOps repositories.
- We'll review the created repositories and explore the CI/CD pipelines, API definitions, and other plugins in the Developer Hub.
- We will use OpenShift Pipelines to build and deploy the application to our development environment as a container.
- Next, we will access the user workspace (OpenShift Dev Spaces) to explore and understand the inner loop development workflow.
- Inside the workspace, we will make a change to the frontend (e.g., changing the voting options from cat vs. dog to cat vs. unicorn) and test the changes locally.
- Once satisfied with the changes, we will commit and push them to the GitOps repository, triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
- We'll verify the changes in the dev environment deployed by the CI/CD pipeline.

## Next Steps 

In the next few exercises, we'll focus on the inner loop development process, which involves making changes to the application code, testing them locally, and pushing the changes to trigger the CI/CD pipeline. We'll learn how the Developer Hub, OpenShift Pipelines, and OpenShift Dev Spaces work together to streamline this process. Let's get started!
