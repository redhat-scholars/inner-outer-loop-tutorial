# Inner Loop Development - Developer Hub

In this section, we'll explore Developer Hub, an link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/01/16/red-hat-developer-hub-your-gateway-seamless-development[Internal Developer Platform (IDP) build from the Backstage project at Spotify]. Developer Hub provides a unified developer experience for building, testing, and deploying applications on OpenShift. It's a single pane of glass for developers to access tools, services, and resources needed to build applications. In this section, we'll use Developer Hub to scaffold the projects for the Vote Application's microservices, view the plugins that extend the functionality of Developer Hub, and explore's features!

## Learning about the Developer Hub

Once we've arrived to the Developer Hub homepage, we can view the various pages and tools that allow us to significantly ease the cloud-native software development experience for our developers.

### Homepage

Upon entering Red Hat Developer Hub, users are created with a homepage to provide quick access and saved links to the various different tools, technologies that are most commonly used. This homepage can be customized to fit the needs of the users.

### Catalog

The Catalog page provides a list of all the services, tools, and resources that are available to developers. It's essentially a well-organized and searchable inventory for everything in your project. For development teams, this catalog is particularly useful for managing project dependencies and mitigating overall risk among the various elements that are interdependent. Here we can view all API's, components, resources, users, and more.

NOTE: For existing services, you can register them by adding a YAML to the repository that defines details about the service, and add them to our catalog.

### APIs

The APIs page is useful for developers who are building applications that require access to external services or data. We're able to register APIs simply by using YAML that has defined information about where the API is located, what it does, and how to access it, and it can build a link:https://swagger.io/[Swagger API] for it and product that API object.

### Learning Paths

The Learning Paths page is particularly useful for developers who are looking to learn new skills or learn a specific technology stack we may use, and is opinionated. There are a number of learning paths out of the box from link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developer].

### Software templates

In Backstage, link:https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/[templates] are a way to create new software projects from a predefined set of files. Templates can be used to create new services or software projects. The Software Templates page provides a list of all the templates that are available to developers, and include all the necessary settings and structures to get projects started. Thus, developers spend less time with configuration and initial setup, and more time on the actual development. In addition, these templates may include the organization's preferred tools for error-checking code, verifying security validations, and building trusted pipelines for a secure supply chain.

### Additional Features

We'll briefly explore some of the additional features that Developer Hub provides:

*Tech Radar*: The Tech Radar page provides a visual representation of the technologies that are being used in the project. It's a great way to see what technologies are being used, and what technologies are being considered for future use.

*Docs*: These are the documentation pages that live together with their code, and are written in Markdown. They provide a way to document the project, and provide information about the project to other developers.

*Clusters*: Developer Hub can be used to manage multiple clusters, and provides a way to view the status of the clusters their resources.

## Kicking off the Software Template Creation

Let's see the power of Developer Hub in action by scaffolding the microservices needed for the Vote Application. We'll use the Software Templates already registered (from a skeleton repository, manifests, and YAML) as a ready-made plan for getting these projects started.

### Creating the Backend Component

Begin from the *Create* button on the left-hand side, and choose the *Go API backend for the Vote App*.

Here, we can leave everything as it is, the name, description, and cluster to set things up on, and click on the *Next* button. 

TIP: How are these values pre-filled? This is thanks to the 
link:https://gitlab-gitlab{console_url}/rhdh/inner-outer-loop-templates/-/blob/main/vote-api-go/template.yaml[`template.yaml`,role='params-link',window='_blank'] that defines all of the specifics for the template, pre-registered to Developer Hub.

Now, for storing the container image, we can leave these parameters as is to specify OpenShift's internal registry, and click on the *Next* button.

Finally, we can review these details on the final page and select the *Create* button to kick off the creation of the Go API backend for the Vote App.

During the creation of this component, Developer Hub is creating the source code repository and the manifest repository, setting up the pipeline and GitOps manifests, and registering this new component on Developer Hub.

We'll view the catalog here shortly to view all of the created resources, but feel free to select *Open Component in catalog* to glance over what the created component looks like!

You can also view the *API* page to see the newly created API for the backend component, `vote-api-{user}`.

### Creating the Frontend Component

Similar to the creation process of the backend component, we'll create the frontend component for the Vote Application. Begin from the *Create* button on the left-hand side, and choose the *Python frontend for the Vote App*.
