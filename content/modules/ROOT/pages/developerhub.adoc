# Kicking things off with Developer Hub

In this section, we'll explore Developer Hub, an link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/01/16/red-hat-developer-hub-your-gateway-seamless-development[Internal Developer Platform (IDP) build from the Backstage project at Spotify]. Developer Hub provides a unified developer experience for building, testing, and deploying applications on OpenShift. It's a single pane of glass for developers to access tools, services, and resources needed to build applications. In this section, we'll use Developer Hub to scaffold the projects for the Vote Application's microservices, view the plugins that extend the functionality of Developer Hub, and explore it's features!

## Learning about the Developer Hub

Once we've arrived to the Developer Hub homepage, we can view the various pages and tools that allow us to significantly ease the cloud-native software development experience for our developers.

### Homepage

Upon entering Red Hat Developer Hub, users are created with a homepage to provide quick access and saved links to the various different tools, technologies that are most commonly used. This homepage can be customized to fit the needs of the users.

### Catalog

The Catalog page provides a list of all the services, tools, and resources that are available to developers. It's essentially a well-organized and searchable inventory for everything in your project. For development teams, this catalog is particularly useful for managing project dependencies and mitigating overall risk among the various elements that are interdependent. Here we can view all API's, components, resources, users, and more.

NOTE: For existing services, you can register them by adding a YAML to the repository that defines details about the service, and add them to our catalog.

### APIs

The APIs page is useful for developers who are building applications that require access to external services or data. We're able to register APIs simply by using YAML that has defined information about where the API is located, what it does, and how to access it, and it can build a link:https://swagger.io/[Swagger API] for it and product that API object.

### Learning Paths

The Learning Paths page is particularly useful for developers who are looking to learn new skills or learn a specific technology stack we may use, and is opinionated. There are a number of learning paths out of the box from link:https://developers.redhat.com/[Red Hat Developer].

image::developer-hub-learning-paths.png[Developer Hub Learning Paths]

### Software templates

In Backstage, link:https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-templates/[templates] are a way to create new software projects from a predefined set of files. Templates can be used to create new services or software projects. The Software Templates page provides a list of all the templates that are available to developers, and include all the necessary settings and structures to get projects started. Thus, developers spend less time with configuration and initial setup, and more time on the actual development. In addition, these templates may include the organization's preferred tools for error-checking code, verifying security validations, and building trusted pipelines for a secure supply chain.

### Additional Features

We'll briefly explore some of the additional features that Developer Hub provides:

*Tech Radar*: The Tech Radar page provides a visual representation of the technologies that are being used in the project. It's a great way to see what technologies are being used, and what technologies are being considered for future use.

image::developer-hub-tech-radar.png[Developer Hub Tech Radar]

*Docs*: These are the documentation pages that live together with their code, and are written in Markdown. They provide a way to document the project, and provide information about the project to other developers.

*Clusters*: Developer Hub can be used to manage multiple clusters, and provides a way to view the status of the clusters their resources.

## Kicking off the Software Template Creation

Let's see the power of Developer Hub in action by scaffolding the microservices needed for the Vote Application. We'll use the Software Templates already registered (from a skeleton repository, manifests, and YAML) as a ready-made plan for getting these projects started.

### Creating the Backend Component

Begin from the *Create* button on the left-hand side, and choose the *Go API backend for the Vote App*.

image::developer-hub-create.png[Developer Hub Create]

Here, we can leave everything as it is, the name, description, and cluster to set things up on, and click on the *Next* button. 

TIP: How are these values pre-filled? This is thanks to the 
link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/inner-outer-loop-templates/-/blob/main/vote-api-go/template.yaml[`template.yaml`,role='params-link',window='_blank'] that defines all of the specifics for the template, pre-registered to Developer Hub.

image::developer-hub-create-go-api.png[Developer Hub Create Go API]

Now, for storing the container image, we can leave these parameters as is to specify OpenShift's internal registry, and click on the *Review* button.

image::developer-hub-create-go-api-image.png[Developer Hub Create Go API Image]

Finally, we can review these details on the final page and select the *Create* button to kick off the creation of the Go API backend for the Vote App.

image::developer-hub-create-go-api-review.png[Developer Hub Create Go API Review]

During the creation of this component, Developer Hub is creating the source code repository and the manifest repository, setting up the GitOps manifests, and registering this new component on Developer Hub.

image::developer-hub-create-go-api-progress.png[Developer Hub Create Go API Progress]

We'll view the catalog here shortly to view all of the created resources, but feel free to select *Open Component in catalog* to glance over what the created component looks like!

image::developer-hub-create-go-api-complete.png[Developer Hub Create Go API Complete]

You can also view the *API* page to see the newly created API for the backend component, `vote-api-{user}`.

image::developer-hub-create-go-api-api.png[Developer Hub Create Go API API]

### Creating the Frontend Component

Similar to the creation process of the backend component, we'll create the frontend component for the Vote Application. Begin from the *Create* button on the left-hand side, and choose the *Python frontend for the Vote App*.

image::developer-hub-create-python.png[Developer Hub Create Python]

Let's leave the pre-filled values as they are and click on the *Next* button. These values will be reflected once the component is created on Developer Hub, and we'll take a look at it shortly.

image::developer-hub-create-python-frontend.png[Developer Hub Create Python Frontend]

On the next page, we can leave the default values for the container image details for the frontend component. Click on the *Review* button.

image::developer-hub-create-python-frontend-image.png[Developer Hub Create Python Frontend Image]

Review the details on the final page and click on the *Create* button to initiate the creation of the Python frontend component.

image::developer-hub-create-python-frontend-review.png[Developer Hub Create Python Frontend Review]

Just like the backend component, Developer Hub will create the necessary repositories, set up the GitOps manifests, and register the frontend component in the catalog.

image::developer-hub-create-python-frontend-progress.png[Developer Hub Create Python Frontend Progress]

## Exploring the Created Components

Once the creation process is complete, you can open the frontend component in the catalog directly from the creation process, or simply visit the Catalog page to view the two created components. Let's explore them in more detail. Here, we can use various filters to search by name, owner, tag, etc.

image::developer-hub-catalog-vote-components.png[Developer Hub Catalog Vote Components]

Let's select on the `vote-api-{user}` component, and here at the *Overview* we can view some basic details of the component, including some handy links, Git repository statistics, source code and tech docs, as well as information pulled from the Argo CD applications that have been created.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-details.png[Developer Hub Vote API Details]

Let's check out some of the other tabs available for the component, powered by the Plugins for Red Hat Developer Hub:

### Topology
View the component's topology within OpenShift and its relationships with other components. This is a great way to get a quick view without having to be within the OpenShift Web Console.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-topology.png[Developer Hub Vote API Topology]

### Issues & Pull/Merge Requests

View and manage Git issues, as well as pull/merge requests, for the source code repository associated with the component.

### CI 
View the status and details of the pipelines created and used by the component, as well as the Pipeline's execution and logs.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-ci.png[Developer Hub Vote API CI]

### CD 
Check out the deployment status and health for Argo CD applications associated with the component. 

image::developer-hub-vote-api-cd.png[Developer Hub Vote API CD]

### Kubernetes
The Kubernetes tab provides a view of the Kubernetes resources associated with the component, including the pods, services, deployments, and other resources. You'll notice there are currently errors with pulling the `vote-api` image, as we haven't built and pushed the image yet using the pipeline.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-kubernetes.png[Developer Hub Vote API Kubernetes]

### API
As we viewed before in it's own section, here we can view the provided and consumed API's for the component.

### Dependencies
This dependency mapping provides a visual representation of the component to users, API's, and more. When you begin to build out a more complex application, this can be a great way to understand the relationships between the various components.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-dependencies.png[Developer Hub Vote API Dependencies]

## Reviewing the Created Repositories

As part of the component creation process, Developer Hub automatically invokes the GitLab (or whichever Git provider you happen to use) to create the necessary repositories for the backend and frontend components. Within the component overview, you can find the links to the source code repositories for the components, or use this link link:{gitlab_url}/{user}/vote-api[here for the vote-api repository,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

image::developer-hub-vote-api-repo.png[Developer Hub Vote API Repo]

In the new page that opened, explore the repository's contents, including the source code files and configuration files (such as the `catalog-info.yaml` that defines the component listing in the catalog). Similarly, feel free navigate to the source code repository for the `vote-ui` component and explore its contents.

image::developer-hub-vote-api-repo-contents.png[Developer Hub Vote API Repo Contents]

In addition to the source code repositories, Developer Hub also creates the corresponding GitOps repositories for each component. These repositories contain the Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts required for deploying the components. You can find this in your user's projects, or use this link link:{gitlab_url}/users/{user}/projects[here to navigate to your projects,role='params-link',window='_blank'].

image::developer-hub-vote-gitops-repo.png[Developer Hub Vote API GitOps Repo]

Explore the contents of the GitOps repositories, including the Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and any other configuration files. We'll be modifying these later on to define the deployment details of our application with Argo CD.

## Next Steps

Developer Hub has saved us time by helping scaffold new projects and ensuring our organization's best practices and security starts from the beginning. With the backend and frontend components created and their respective repositories set up, let's now kick off the pipelines to build and deploy the applications to OpenShift.
