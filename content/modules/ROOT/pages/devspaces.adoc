# Making Updates to our Application

With the Vote Application deployed to our `vote-app-dev-{user}` development project, we can now use OpenShift Dev Spaces to develop and test our application. link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift Dev Spaces,window='_blank'] is a browser-based IDE that allows you to develop in the cloud. It provides a ready-to-use development stack with a web-based IDE, terminal, and version control support. It also provides pre-built developer workspaces that allow you to start coding immediately, which we'll use in this lab. We'll quickly view the source code of our `vote-api` application, and make changes to the `vote-ui` application to see the results in real-time, and push these changes to our repository.

## Getting setup with Dev Spaces

Let's start by getting more familiar with the Dev Spaces interface, which supports multiple in-browser IDE's such as  Microsoft Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. Either we can use the OpenShift Web Console application launcher, or more simply, go from the `vote-api` *Developer Hub* component to launch *Dev Spaces* for our specific source code.

NOTE: We'll start with the `vote-api` source code, but we'll also be making changes to the `vote-ui` source code after in Dev Spaces.

This will open up the Dev Spaces interface. You'll need to first log in with `rhsso` using your existing credentials and authorize `devspaces` to use your GitLab login.

image::devspaces-login.png[Dev Spaces Login]

NOTE: In the background, the provisioning of this development environment is happening. This is thanks to the link:https://devfile.io/[`devfile`,window='_blank'] that we've defined in our `vote-api` and `vote-ui` application repository, which defines the necessary components and commands to get to coding right away!

Once the Dev Spaces interface opens, we'll have to hit *Trust Workspace & Install* and *Yes, I trust the authors* to install the required components and enable permissions needed for this lab.

There may be a _Get Started_ tab in the dashboard that you can close, but from here, we can begin to make changes to the Vote Application. But first, let's get familiar with the powerful features of Dev Spaces.

image::devspaces-interface.png[Dev Spaces Interface]

### Extension support

Built from the open source link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che,window='_blank'] project, Dev Spaces supports Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions and Language Server Protocol. This means you can use your favorite Visual Studio Code extensions in Dev Spaces. You can also use the Language Server Protocol to provide language features like auto-complete, go-to-definition, and hover support.

### Terminal support

Dev Spaces also provides a terminal that allows you to run commands in your workspace. This is useful for running commands like `mvn clean package` or `npm install` to build your application. You can also use the terminal to run commands within your OpenShift cluster without needing to authenticate, just like the OpenShift Web Terminal.

With the Dev Spaces built-in terminal, let's run the following commands to test a bit of Python code to print some text in our terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
python
----

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
print("Hello from Dev Spaces")
----

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
quit()
----

### Git support

Dev Spaces also provides a built-in version control system. This allows you to commit and push your changes to a Git repository. You can also use the version control system to pull changes from a Git repository.

## Testing the Vote Application API in Dev Spaces

### Running the Vote Application API

Let's first set up the dependencies for our application and run the Vote Application locally. From the top left corner, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task*. 

image::devspaces-run-task.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

We can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Run API* from here. This will install the necessary dependencies for the Vote Application API and run the application in development by doing a `go get -d && go run main.go"`, as defined in the local `devfile`.

image::devspaces-run-task-2.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

Now, we're running the API and can view the different endpoints available. We can click on the *Open in New Tab* button to open the Vote Application API in a new browser tab.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

From the various endpoints shown in the Terminal, we can check out the `/vote` endpoint to see the different options available for the Vote Application.

TIP: You will need to append the beginning of the URL to http instead of https to view the API in the browser. This is because of the self-signed certificate used in the development environment.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser-1.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

When returning to the Dev Spaces interface, we can see the Vote Application API running in the terminal, and the GET requests to the `/vote` endpoint.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser-2.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

## Developing the Vote Application UI in Dev Spaces

Let's make some changes to the frontend of our application. Again, just like we did with the `vote-api` application, let's navigate in *Developer Hub* to the `vote-ui` application and launch *Dev Spaces*.

image::openshift-dev-spaces-dev-hub-2.png[OpenShift Dev Spaces Dev Hub]

After going through the same steps as before, we'll be in the Dev Spaces interface for the `vote-ui` application.

image::devspaces-interface-2.png[Dev Spaces Interface]

Let's go ahead and install the dependencies to get this project setup. From the upper left-hand menu, select *Terminal* and hit *Run Task*. We can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Install dependencies* from here. This will install the necessary Python dependencies, namely `Flask` for web development, and `requests` for making HTTP requests.

image::devspaces-run-task-3.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

Next, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task* again. We can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Run Python App* from here. This will run the Vote Application in development by doing a `python app.py`, as defined in the local `devfile`.

image::devspaces-run-task-4.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

Click on the *Open in New Tab* button to open the Vote Application in a new browser tab. You'll now see a pop-up in the lower right corner about a new process running on port 8080. We can see live code changes to the Vote Application running in the browser using this. It may take a few seconds, but you should see the Vote Application running.

TIP: You'll need click the *Yes* button to open the Vote Application in a new browser tab, and possibly change to `http://` instead of `https://` to view the application. This is because of the self-signed certificate used in the development environment.

image::devspaces-run-app-browser.png[Dev Spaces Run App Browser]

We can now begin to make changes to the Vote Application from the Dev Spaces interface, and for our use case, we want to change a voting option to a unicorn! We can edit the `app.py` and `index.html` file in the to do this.

### Making changes to our application

Let's start out in the `app.py`, on line 11, where can change the text from `option_b = os.getenv('OPTION_B', u"Dog üê∂")` to `option_b = os.getenv('OPTION_B', u"Unicorn ü¶Ñ")`. Feel free to copy the below code and insert it on line 11.

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
option_b = os.getenv('OPTION_B', u"Unicorn ü¶Ñ")
----

image::devspaces-edit-title.png[Dev Spaces Edit Title]

You'll notice the changes are saved automatically, and you can see the application updating in real-time in the browser with a refresh of your page.

image::devspaces-run-app-browser-1.png[Dev Spaces Run App Browser]

Thanks to the variable being used in the `templates/index.html`, the references have been updated to reflect the new changes as well.

image::devspaces-edit-title-2.png[Dev Spaces Edit Title]

### Performing a security scan

Now that we've made changes to the Vote Application frontend, we can secure our application and analyze our dependencies by performing a security scan. Dependency Analytics is powered by the link:https://security.snyk.io/[Snyk Intel Vulnerability DB,window='_blank'], the industry's most advanced and accurate open-source vulnerability database.

We can right-click the *requirements.txt* file from the left menu to do this. From here, we can select *Red Hat Dependency Analytics Report* to perform a security scan on the Vote Application.

image::devspaces-snyk.png[Dev Spaces Snyk]

This will open up a new tab in Dev Spaces with the security scan results. Here, we can see information about security issues, dependencies, licenses, and add-ons.

image::devspaces-snyk-report.png[Dev Spaces Snyk Report]

### Pushing changes to the Git repository

Now that we've tested our changes, we can push our changes to the Git repository. We can select the *Source Control* tab from the left menu to do this. We can first enter a commit message (ex. `Modified voting options`), and from here, we can select the dropdown to the right of the ‚úì Commit button to *Commit & Push* our changes to the Git repository, 

image::devspaces-commit.png[Dev Spaces Commit]

You'll then see a prompt about staging and committing your changes. We can select *Yes* from here to stage and commit our changes.

image::devspaces-commit-2.png[Dev Spaces Commit]

## Viewing the updated application in development

Now that we've pushed our changes to the Git repository and with the pipelines configured to to the repository, our changes trigger a rebuild of the `vote-ui` application image. We can view this in Developer Hub under the `vote-ui-{user}` component, under the *CI* tab.

image::developer-hub-devspaces-pipeline.png[Dev Spaces Pipeline]

NOTE: We can also navigate to the OpenShift Web Console and select *Pipelines* from the `vote-app-dev-{user}` project, the check out the *PipelineRuns*.

Now, Argo CD will automatically pick up on these changes, and will resync the updated image to the `vote-app-dev-{user}` project. We can view this in the Argo CD interface here shortly.

image::devspaces-argocd-sync.png[Dev Spaces Argo CD Sync]

Once the sync is complete, we can view the updated `vote-ui` application in the `vote-app-dev-{user}` project. We can view the application in the OpenShift Web Console *Topology* view, and select the route to view the application in the browser.

image::devspaces-argocd-sync-2.png[Dev Spaces Argo CD Sync]

We can now see the new _Unicorn_ option in the development environment of the Vote Application. We've successfully made changes to the Vote Application frontend in Dev Spaces, and pushed these changes to the Git repository, but finally need to move our application to the production environment.

image::devspaces-vote-app.png[Dev Spaces Vote Application]

## Promoting our frontend to production

Looks like our application is working as expected in the development environment. Let's promote our changes to the production environment, which can be done from the OpenShift Web Console *Pipelines* dashboard from the left-hand side. Here, we'll select the `vote-ui-promote` pipeline.

image::openshift-web-console-pipelines-prod.png[Developer Hub Pipelines]

Let‚Äôs start the pipeline by clicking on the top-right *Actions* then *Start* button to kick things off.

image::openshift-web-console-pipelines-prod-start.png[Developer Hub Pipelines Start]

You will be prompted to enter the values for the pipeline parameters, however the default values are already set for you. This includes the source Git repository and details, as well as the Argo CD host to update the image tag. Hit the *Start* button again to kick off the process.

image::openshift-web-console-pipelines-prod-start-2.png[Developer Hub Pipelines Start]

When this PipelineRun finishes up, our changes made in development will now be reflected in our production environment, and can be viewied from the *Topology* view in the `vote-app-dev-{user}` project.

image::openshift-web-console-topology-prod.png[Developer Hub Topology]

After opening the frontend in the browser through the *Route*, we can also check out the results of the votes through the `/result` endpoint.

image::openshift-web-console-topology-prod-2.png[Developer Hub Topology]

## Next steps

In this section, we've successfully deployed the Vote Application to the `vote-app-dev-{user}` development project, and made changes to the frontend of the application using OpenShift Dev Spaces. We've tested our changes in development, and promoted our changes to the production environment. We've also learned about the powerful features of cloud native development using Dev Spaces with VSCode, such as extension support, terminal support, and Git support.
