# Making Updates to our Application

With the Vote Application deployed to our `vote-app-dev-{user}` development project, we can now use OpenShift Dev Spaces to develop and test our application. link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift Dev Spaces,window='_blank'] is a browser-based IDE that allows you to develop in the cloud. It provides a ready-to-use development stack with a web-based IDE, terminal, and version control support. It also provides pre-built developer workspaces that allow you to start coding immediately, which we'll use in this lab. We'll quickly view the source code of our `vote-api` application, and make changes to the `vote-ui` application to see the results in real-time, and push these changes to our repository.

## Getting setup with Dev Spaces

Let's start by getting more familiar with the Dev Spaces interface, which supports multiple in-browser IDE's such as  Microsoft Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. Either we can use the OpenShift Web Console application launcher, or more simply, go from the `vote-api` *Developer Hub* component to launch *Dev Spaces* for our specific source code.

This will open up the Dev Spaces interface. You'll need to first log in with `rhsso` using your existing credentials and authorize `devspaces` to use your GitLab login.

image::devspaces-login.png[Dev Spaces Login]

NOTE: In the background, the provisioning of this development environment is happening. This is thanks to the `devfile`link:https://devfile.io/[`devfile`,window='_blank'] that we've defined in our `vote-api` and `vote-ui` application repository, which defines the necessary components and commands to get to coding right away!

Once the Dev Spaces interface opens, we'll have to hit *Trust Workspace & Install* and *Yes, I trust the authors* to install the required components and enable permissions needed for this lab.

There may be a _Get Started_ tab in the dashboard that you can close, but from here, we can begin to make changes to the Vote Application. But first, let's get familiar with the powerful features of Dev Spaces.

image::devspaces-interface.png[Dev Spaces Interface]

### Extension support

Built from the open source link:https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipse Che,window='_blank'] project, Dev Spaces supports Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions and Language Server Protocol. This means you can use your favorite Visual Studio Code extensions in Dev Spaces. You can also use the Language Server Protocol to provide language features like auto-complete, go-to-definition, and hover support.

### Terminal support

Dev Spaces also provides a terminal that allows you to run commands in your workspace. This is useful for running commands like `mvn clean package` or `npm install` to build your application. You can also use the terminal to run commands within your OpenShift cluster without needing to authenticate, just like the OpenShift Web Terminal.

With the Dev Spaces built-in terminal, let's run the following commands to test a bit of Python code to print some text in our terminal.

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
print("Hello from Dev Spaces")
----

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
quit()
----

### Git support

Dev Spaces also provides a built-in version control system. This allows you to commit and push your changes to a Git repository. You can also use the version control system to pull changes from a Git repository.

## Testing the Vote Application API in Dev Spaces

### Installing the application dependencies

Let's first set up the dependencies for our application and run the Vote Application locally. From the top left corner, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task*. 

image::devspaces-run-task.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

We can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Run API* from here. This will install the necessary dependencies for the Vote Application API and run the application in development.

image::devspaces-run-task-2.png[Dev Spaces Run Task]

Now, we're running the API and can view the different endpoints available. We can click on the *Open in New Tab* button to open the Vote Application API in a new browser tab.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

From the various endpoints shown in the Terminal, we can check out the `/vote` endpoint to see the different options available for the Vote Application.

TIP: You will need to append the beginning of the URL to http instead of https to view the API in the browser.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser-1.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

When returning to the Dev Spaces interface, we can see the Vote Application API running in the terminal, and the GET requests to the `/vote` endpoint.

image::devspaces-run-task-browser-2.png[Dev Spaces Run Task Browser]

## Developing the Vote Application UI in Dev Spaces

Next, we can select *Terminal* and then *Run Task* again. We can select *Show all tasks* and *devfile: Run Python App* from here. This will run the Vote Application in development.

image::devspaces-run-app.png[Dev Spaces Run App]

Click on the *Open in New Tab* button to open the Vote Application in a new browser tab. You'll now see a pop-up in the lower right corner about a new process running on port 8080. We can see live code changes to the Vote Application running in the browser using this.

image::devspaces-run-app-browser.png[Dev Spaces Run App Browser]

From here, we can click the *Yes* button to open the Vote Application in a new browser tab. It may take a few seconds, but you should see the Vote Application running.

image::devspaces-run-app-browser-1.png[Dev Spaces Run App Browser]

We can now begin to make changes to the Vote Application from the Dev Spaces interface. We can edit the `index.html` file in the `templates` directory to do this. 

### Live coding within Dev Spaces

image::devspaces-edit.png[Dev Spaces Edit]

Here, on line 16, we can change the text from `{{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}!` to `{{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}! - OpenShift Dev Spaces`. This will change the title of the Vote Application to *Vote App - OpenShift Dev Spaces*. Feel free to copy the below code and insert it on line 16.

[.console-input]
[source,python,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
<h1>{{option_a}} vs {{option_b}}! - OpenShift Dev Spaces</h1>
----

image::devspaces-edit-title.png[Dev Spaces Edit Title]

Now, if we return to our new tab with the local Vote Application running, we can see the new changes we've made updated automatically.

image::devspaces-run-app-browser-2.png[Dev Spaces Run App Browser]

## Performing a security scan

Now that we've made changes to the Vote Application, we can secure our application and analyze our dependencies by performing a security scan. Dependency Analytics is powered by the link:https://security.snyk.io/[Snyk Intel Vulnerability DB,window='_blank'], the industry's most advanced and accurate open-source vulnerability database.

We can right-click the *requirements.txt* file from the left menu to do this. From here, we can select *Dependency Analytics Report* to perform a security scan on the Vote Application.

image::devspaces-snyk.png[Dev Spaces Snyk]

This will open up a new tab in Dev Spaces with the security scan results. Here, we can see information about security issues, dependencies, licenses, and add-ons.

image::devspaces-snyk-report.png[Dev Spaces Snyk Report]

## Pushing changes to the Git repository

Now that we've tested our changes, we can push our changes to the Git repository. We can select the *Source Control* tab from the left menu to do this. We can first enter a commit message (ex. `Modified index.html header`), and from here, we can select the dropdown to the right of the âœ“ Commit button to *Commit & Push* our changes to the Git repository, 

image::devspaces-commit.png[Dev Spaces Commit]

You'll then see a prompt about staging and committing your changes. We can select *Yes* from here to stage and commit our changes.

image::devspaces-commit-2.png[Dev Spaces Commit]

## Syncing changes to the Vote Application

Now that we've pushed our changes to the Git repository and with the webhook configured, our changes trigger a rebuild of the `vote-ui` application image. To see this in real-time, we can navigate to the OpenShift Web Console and select the `vote-app-ci-%USERID%` project. From here, we can select *Pipelines* from the left menu. We should see the pipeline `vote-app-ui-pipeline` running and rebuilding the Vote Application.

image::devspaces-pipeline.png[Dev Spaces Pipeline]

Once the pipeline has completed, in the link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%/%USERID%/vote-app-gitops/[vote-app-gitops,role='params-link',window='_blank'] repository, there will be a new commit from Tekton that will contain the new hash for the Vote Application image. 

image::devspaces-gitops-commit.png[Dev Spaces GitOps Commit]

Now, Argo CD will automatically pick up on these changes from the repository. To deploy the new image to the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project, head back to Argo CD and select the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` application. You'll see that the application is now out of sync, and hasn't been updated, as we declared in our `Application` resource that we didn't want _self-healing_ enabled. However, to view the new changes from the top menu, click on *Sync*.

image::devspaces-argocd-sync.png[Dev Spaces Argo CD Sync]

Now, select *Synchronize*. This will deploy the new image to the `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` project.

image::argocd-sync.png[Argo CD Sync]

## Next steps

Making these changes manually is a good solution for our development environment, but let's move this application to production and automate all of this. For this, we can use a separate pipeline to deploy the application to the `vote-app-prod-%USERID%` project.
