# Workshop Overview - Setup

In this section, we'll look at the setup of the OpenShift cluster we're using for today's lab. This includes Developer Hub and the OpenShift Operators that have been installed, as well as the projects that have been created for you. We'll look at the operators we'll be using throughout the lab, including OpenShift Dev Spaces, OpenShift Pipelines, and OpenShift GitOps.

## Red Hat Developer Tools

Let's look at some of the inner and outer loop developer flow tools Red Hat provides. This includes tools for building, testing, deploying, and running applications. These tools are integrated and work together to provide a seamless developer experience. We can break these tools down as shown below.

### Red Hat Developer Hub

link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*Developer Hub*,window='_blank'] is a centralized, internal developer platform that provides a unified experience for developers to discover, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift. It serves as a single entry point for developers, offering a curated catalog of software templates, learning resources, and a comprehensive view of the application landscape.

### Inner Loop: OpenShift Dev Spaces

link:https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[*OpenShift Dev Spaces*,window='_blank'] is a cloud and container-native development environment that provides a fast, secure, and zero-configuration development environment for Kubernetes and OpenShift. It allows developers to bootstrap their development environment and start coding quickly.

### Outer Loop: OpenShift Pipelines

link:https://catalog.redhat.com/software/container-stacks/detail/5ec54a4628834587a6b85ca5[*OpenShift Pipelines*,window='_blank'] is a cloud-native, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) solution for building pipelines using link:https://tekton.dev[*Tekton*,window='_blank']. Tekton is a flexible, Kubernetes-native, open-source CI/CD framework that enables automating deployments across multiple platforms (Kubernetes, serverless, VMs, etc.) by abstracting away the underlying implementation details.

### Outer Loop: OpenShift GitOps

link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/pipelines/understanding-openshift-pipelines.html[*OpenShift GitOps*,window='_blank'] is a GitOps solution for OpenShift that provides a declarative, GitOps-centric approach to managing applications and their delivery based on link:https://argoproj.github.io/cd/[*Argo CD*,window='_blank']. It provides a set of tools that allow developers to manage the application lifecycle, including deploying, updating, and deleting applications using Git as the source of truth.

// to pull our code from Gitea, build it, and update the Gitea repository with the new image tag. Follow these instructions in order to install OpenShift Pipelines on OpenShift via the OperatorHub:

## Environment Setup

NOTE: Everything has already been pre-installed on your cluster, so there's no need to do anything here. This is just for reference.

Throughout this lab, you'll have your own account on an OpenShift 4.12 cluster. To save time, this cluster has been pre-configured with the below OpenShift Operators. You can think of Operators as add-ons to an OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster that provide extended features/capabilities. We've attached screenshots of each operator's details page, as only the cluster *admin* account can view these details.

### Operator: OpenShift Pipelines 
We'll use *OpenShift Pipelines* to pull our code from Git, build it, and update the Git repository with the new image tag.

image::pipelines-operator-details.png[Pipelines Details]

### Operator: OpenShift GitOps 
We'll use *OpenShift GitOps* to deploy our application to the cluster and manage the application lifecycle. Our two projects, `vote-app-dev-%USERID%` and `vote-app-prod-%USERID%`, will be managed by ArgoCD, and we'll be able to demonstrate high availability using GitOps.

### Operator: OpenShift Dev Spaces
We'll use *OpenShift Dev Spaces* to bootstrap our development environment quickly and start coding. We'll be able to make changes to our code and see them reflected in the cluster in real time and commit our changes to Git.

### Operator: OpenShift Web Terminal
Finally, the *Web Terminal* is a web-based terminal for OpenShift. It allows users to access a terminal in a pod from the OpenShift Web Console, and it'll help us work within our cluster without having to download the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[*OpenShift CLI (oc)*,window='_blank'].

## Lab Checks

// ### OpenShift Operators

// This OpenShift cluster has been pre-configured with the operators listed above, cluster-wide, and we can confirm this from the *admin* account. Firstly, navigate to the *Administrator* perspective, and click on *Operators* from within the left-hand menu. Now, click on *Installed Operators* from the sub-menu.

// image::operators-button.png[Operators Button]

// Here, we can view the operators that have been installed to our cluster, as well as various details about their installation, etc.

// image::installed-operators.png[Installed Operators]

// By clicking on one of these operators, we can view the CustomResourceDefinitions they have defined, documentation, and much more.

// image::gitops-operator-details.png[Operator Details]

// While we won't be using the *admin* account during this lab, it's still important to understand these operators as they help extend the functionality of OpenShift and allow us to perform this lab.

### OpenShift

First, let's ensure we're logged into the *OpenShift* cluster. You can access the OpenShift Console from the *Lab Guides*, or you can visit the OpenShift Console using this link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%[*OpenShift Web Console Link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. 

image::openshift-login.png[OpenShift Page Login]

You'll be prompted to log in to OpenShift, and you can use the OpenShift login button to do so. As a reference, here are your credentials:

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

image::openshift-dashboard.png[OpenShift Dashboard]

Once you're logged in, you'll be at the OpenShift dashboard. If you aren't already, you can navigate to the *Developer* perspective, where we'll be spending most of our time.

### Developer Hub

Let's also view the process of accessing the *Developer Hub*. You can access the Developer Hub Console from the *Lab Guides*, or you can visit the Developer Hub Console using this link: https://console-developer-hub.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Developer Hub Web Console Link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. 

Using the GitLab identity provider, you'll automatically log in with the below credentials to view the Developer Hub dashboard.

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

### Argo CD

Let's look at *Argo CD*, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes provided in the OpenShift GitOps Operator. While you can access Argo CD from the *Lab Guides* or by using this link:https://argocd-server-argocd-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Argo CD link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. You can also visit Argo CD from your OpenShift cluster. Within the *Developer* perspective, navigate to the `argocd-%USERID%` project, and visit the *Topology* page.

image::argocd-button.png[Argo CD Route Button]

From your project's *Topology* page, click on the *Argo CD* route to visit the Argo CD dashboard. You'll be prompted to log in to Argo CD, and you can use the OpenShift login button to do so.

image::argocd-login.png[Argo CD Login]

As a reference, here are your credentials:

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

You'll need to authorize the Argo CD application to access your OpenShift cluster. Click the *Allow selected permissions* button to authorize Argo CD to access your OpenShift cluster. 

image::argocd-allow.png[Argo CD Allow]

Now, you'll be directed to the Argo CD dashboard.

### Vote App Repository

You can access Gitea from the *Lab Guides*, or you can visit Gitea using this link:https://gitea.%SUBDOMAIN%[*Gitea Link*,role='params-link',window='_blank']. Once Developer Hub is used to create the backend and frotend component repositories, both the source code repositories and GitOps manifests will be visible in Gitea.

As a reference, here are your credentials:

- Username: `%USERID%`
- Password: `openshift`

## Next steps

Your environment is now ready to go! The cluster has been pre-configured with the necessary OpenShift Operators, and you have access to Argo CD and the necessary Git repositories. From here, we can wrap up the introduction and begin our lab!
